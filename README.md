## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from New York City to better understand:

1. What are the most expensive neighborhoods in New York City?
2. What are the most popular neighborhoods in New York City?
3. What are the most popular room types in New York City?
4. What are the most popular amenities in New York City?
5. What are the most popular property types in New York City?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in my personal page of GitHub.
